# Lending Club Case Study
> consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## General Information
- This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided by a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The company aims to minimize the risk of financial loss associated with lending by identifying patterns that indicate whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

### Business Problem
The company faces two primary risks:
1. Loss of business by not approving loans to applicants who are likely to repay.
2. Financial loss by approving loans to applicants who are likely to default.

By analyzing the data, we aim to identify the characteristics of applicants who are likely to default. This insight will help the company reduce credit loss by making better-informed lending decisions.

### Dataset
Loan Dataset has been used

# Observations

### The above analysis with respect to the charged off loans. There is a more probability of defaulting when :
- Applicants taking loan for 'home improvement' and have income of 60k -70k
- Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have income of 60-70k
- Applicants who receive interest at the rate of 21-24% and have an income of 70k-80k
- Applicants who have taken a loan in the range 30k - 35k and are charged interest rate of 15-17.5 %
- Applicants who have taken a loan for small business and the loan amount is greater than 14k
- Applicants whose home ownership is 'MORTGAGE and have loan of 14-16k
- When grade is F and loan amount is between 15k-20k
- When employment length is 10yrs and loan amount is 12k-14k
- When the loan is verified and loan amount is above 16k
